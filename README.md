# SSHCrack
Tool for cracking into SSH IoT devices with built in Shodan API capabilities for optimal automation. This is essentially my own Hydra clone with psuedo multi threading and Shodan API capabilities to attack large amounts of targets effeciently.

The idea came from a video by David Bombal interviewing with a hacker who's efforts were against the Russian Federation in assistance of Ukraine. He mainly hacked Russia's SCADA systems along with assistance from Shodan. My idea was to basically automate this process by iterating through a large number of targets utilizing python's pseudo multi threading for faster cracking.
